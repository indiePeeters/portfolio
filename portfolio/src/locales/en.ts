    whyellowDescription: "During my time at Whyellow, I worked with a dedicated team on two big projects. I was one of the few team members who loved frontend development, so I ended up handling the frontend work for both projects.<br /><br />One of these projects was a web system for Partou, which I\\'ll talk about more here. During this project, I took on some major tasks and gradually became one of the more experienced team members. As the project continued, I also took over the responsibility of making the user experience and design better. <br /><br /> On top of all that, I had the chance to help out junior software developers and show them the ropes in frontend development.",
