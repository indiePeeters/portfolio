      mapcreatorDescription: `
        Besides my studies, I worked at Mapcreator. In the beginning, I focused on making maps look good for our customers by customizing styles, text, icons, and pop-ups in our software. 
        I used Illustrator and created scripts to automate this process and make it more efficient.<br /><br />

        Later, I had the chance to do an internship at Mapcreator and joined the development team.
        My main task during the internship was to move the remaining mapping features from our old software to the web, which was quite a challenge.

      openCircleDescription: `
        During my graduation internship at Open Circle Solutions, I had the opportunity to delve into the realm of augmented reality. 
        I was assigned to a project focused on integrating augmented reality with cross-platform app development.<br /><br />
      
        Throughout the course of this project, I gained an understanding of the processes involved in the creation of augmented reality applications. 
        Additionally, I conducted research on various design and implementation strategies for augmented reality within cross-platform app environments.<br /><br />

      beyonderDescription: `
        During my time at Beyonder, I worked with a dedicated team on two big projects. 
        I was one of the few team members who loved frontend development, so I ended up handling the frontend work for both projects.<br /><br />
        
        One of these projects was a web system for Partou, which I\'ll talk about more <a href="/projects/partou">here</a>. 
        During this project, I took on some major tasks and gradually became one of the more experienced team members. 
        As the project continued, I also took over the responsibility of making the user experience and design better. <br /><br /> 
        
        On top of all that, I had the chance to help out junior software developers and show them the ropes in frontend development.`,
